# Practical Session - Week 6 #

In this week's session we will simulate a bit of collaborative work through git.

A simple C project is given, where a HW Adapter Pattern must be implemented.

The starting point is on the practice folder.

Each participant in the session must implement both, a HW proxy module and a HW Adapter to be integrated with the main Project.

## Rules of Engagement ##
* We will split in both: groups and individuals.
* An integrator will be chosen.
* The integrator will create the repository, add others as collaborators.
* Each collaborator will create a branch and start working.
